# my-top-10-movie-website

Have you ever seen websites that compile lists of their top favourite movies of all time?

a website just like that using Flask/WTForms/SQLite/SQLAlchemy and more. It will allow us to create a beautiful website that lists our top 10 films of all time.
As we watch more movies, we can always update our list and keep track of which movies to recommend people.

I used this free API to search movie https://developers.themoviedb.org/3/search/search-movies

and you can search by ID from here https://developers.themoviedb.org/3/movies/get-movie-details

Note: You have to install Flask and SQLAlchemy
